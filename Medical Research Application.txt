PROGRAM STRUCTURE

1.I have considered a class Disease and set few properties in them
2.I have used enum to set custom datatypes in the program
3.I have used 'DoctorApp' as a class to perform all the functions such as 'Adding New Disease', 'Adding new symptoms', 'Checking Patients'.
4.I have considered 'HelperFunctions' class to use switch case statements to perform various cases as the user enters his requirements.
5.I have taken 'UIMenu' as my main class which calls a start() function, and the program executes.

PROCEDURE

1. We can use ArrayList instead of Array since we do not know how many diseases the user is going to enter.
2. We can store all the inputs required for Case:1 by using and calling a respective function.
3. We then move to Case:2 where we first ask the disease for which the user wants to add symptoms for, and we will check if that disease
is already present in the ArrayList we created in Case:1. If the disease is not present then we ask the user to first register the 
disease and then add the symptoms for the same.
4. Then in Case:3 only when the symptoms entered match with the symptoms entered in Case:2 then all the diseases with matching symptoms will 
be displayed in the console.

INBUILT CLASSES USED
1. ENUM
2. ArrayList
